# Lovely_Bird

A game cloned or inspired by the popular "Flappy Bird," with some minor changes.

## How to Play

### Starting the Game

1. Open the "Lovely_Bird" app on your device.
2. The game will start automatically once the app is launched.

### Bird Control

- The bird will automatically move forward.
- Tap anywhere on the screen to make the bird flap its wings and gain height.
- Each tap results in a small upward movement of the bird.

### Navigating through Pipes

- Observe the gaps between pairs of green pipes.
- Guide the bird through the gaps to avoid hitting pipes or the ground.

### Timing is Crucial

- The bird falls due to gravity when not flapping, so timing is crucial.
- Tap too early, and the bird might not clear the pipes.
- Tap too late, and the bird could crash into the pipes.

### Scoring

- Earn a point each time you pass through a pair of pipes.
- Pipes appear at varying heights and patterns as you progress.

### Challenge and Perseverance

- Embrace the difficulty of the game; frequent crashes are part of the challenge.
- Aim for the highest possible score by successfully navigating through pipes.

### Game Over

1. If the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game ends.
2. Your final score will be displayed on the screen.
3. Tap "Play Again" or "Retry" to start a new game.

### Practice and Improvement

- Regular practice improves timing and reflexes.
- Mastery comes with experience, helping you navigate pipes more effectively.

### Sharing Your High Score

- Some versions of the game allow sharing high scores on social media.
- Compete with friends to achieve the highest score.

### Enjoyment

- Find satisfaction in overcoming the game's challenges.
- Appreciate the game's retro-inspired graphics and addictive nature.

Remember that while the game can be frustrating, practice and perseverance will help you guide the bird through those tricky gaps!
